# my-bash-files

.bashrc files for Ubuntu and Fedora

## Installing

For installing run
```sh
chmod a+x install.sh
./install.sh
```

For configuring run
```sh
chmo a+x configure.sh
./configure.sh
```

### When install and when configure

If I need to configure without been able to push to the github I will suggest to install.

Otherwise configure should be better.
